## Api's Swift Journey
Apiphoom was a young programmer from Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ who had a passion for coding. He had been programming for several years, but his true love was the [Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). He was fascinated by its simplicity and elegance, and he spent hours every day experimenting with new code and learning new features.

Determined to master the language, Apiphoom spent countless hours learning and experimenting with Swift. His hard work paid off when he was awarded the [Apple WWDC Scholarship Swift Student Challenge in 2021](https://www.flashfly.net/wp/345856). Overjoyed, Apiphoom redoubled his efforts and continued to improve his skills.

To his surprise and delight, he was once again awarded the [Apple WWDC Scholarship Swift Student Challenge in 2022](https://www.techoffside.com/2022/06/apple-wwdc22-swift-student-challenge/). This made him the first Thai to receive the award two years in a row, and the only Thai to receive the award twice.
