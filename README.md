## Anime & Character that Api Love
I absolutely adore [Lycoris Recoil](https://lycoris-recoil.fandom.com/wiki/Lycoris_Recoil_Wiki), especially [Chisato Nishikigi](https://lycoris-recoil.fandom.com/wiki/Chisato_Nishikigi) & [Takina Inoue](https://lycoris-recoil.fandom.com/wiki/Takina_Inoue)'s lovely personality. [The Angel Next Door Spoil Me Rotten](https://otonari-no-tenshi.fandom.com/wiki/The_Angel_Next_Door_Spoils_Me_Rotten) is another favorite of mine, with [Mahiru Shiina](https://otonari-no-tenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Mahiru_Shiina)'s kind and gentle demeanor winning me over completely. Check them out for yourself and experience the same joy and love that I have found.
